                My name is William Thackeray. I have always been a big fan of content creation and 
                have wanted to be a content creator for as long as I can remember. This could have
                been as a Youtuber or a Live Streamer, but somehow, someway, I wanted to create content 
                of some sort and have people want to watch me do it. Originally, I was working towards
                being a youtuber. Over the years I have made many different kinds of videos. Video games, 
                music videos, short story videos, vlogs, and even small examples of my graphic creations. 
                I always loved making videos, but never had the means to make them consistently and to the 
                tier of quiality I would have liked, until recently. <br><br> Late in 2019 I was able to start 
                making different graphics for my channel. I started with small logos
                and making my channel art all match. I was really able to make things exactly how I visioned, because
                I had the capability. I've been working on art projects of many different kinds before, throughout, 
                and after high school and have espacially loved graphic design projects. I really have found my niche to 
                be <em>vector design</em> and I've loved making different layouts for my channels to make it all come together. <br><br>
                They types of graphics I make are: <br id="graphics"></p>
            <ul> <!-- Find a graphics example of one of these to place near this list. -->
                <li>Stingers</li>
                <li>Intros</li>
                <li>Layouts</li>
                <li>Logos</li>
                <li>Animations</li>
                <li>Overlays</li>
                <li>Entire Channel Revamps</li>
                <li>Merchendise Design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I started Thack Whack Graphics because I know that there are many small content creators, like myself,
                who don't know how, or can't access programs to create graphics for their channels. This was a limitation
                for me that limitted me in what I felt I could accomplish in my content creation journey. What I want 
                to be able to accomplish with Thack Whack Graphics is to bring conent creators a specifically cultivated,
                specially contructed graphics and animations for their channels so they can be confident that they are bringing 
                the most quality content to their viewers. <br><br> When I am not making illustrations for creators, I do a lot of 
                artwork for myself, finishing up projects, starting other small side projects, and continuing to perfect my own 
                vibe for my own channels. I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thack_whack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">stream on Twitch</a> 
                myself when I have time and love connecting with viewers and my other streaming buddies. I am not as
                active on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi1akH4p574h6J9N2ONQT0w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my YouTube channel</a> 
                as I would like to be, but I upload there ocasionally as well. I am also a student
                at Utah Valley University where I am learning Coding and hopefully one day will be able to throw together some
                game ideas I have in the back of my mind. <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Commission Design</h2>
            <p>
                When I receive a commission, there are some things I need to know before I get started:
            </p>
            <ol> 
                <li>Channel Name</li>
                <li>Color Scheme (can be picked from <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adobe Color</a>)</li>
                <li>Channel Theme</li>
                <li>Requested Graphics (stinger, logo, total revamp, etc.)</li>
                <li>Perferred Deadline</li>
                <li>Budget</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The reason we need to talk about these six items is that these six things help me to know exactly what you
                need and specifically what style you're looking for. The more specific we can get, then the better I can know 
                how to deliver a product that is exactly what is needed. I need to know the <strong>channel name</strong>, because that is 
                a very important part of the branding as it is <em>your</em> brand. The <strong>color scheme</strong> is another key part 
                of the rebranding, as whatever I create needs to match what you already have, or bring the specific 
                vibe you're looking for. This plays into a key part of the <strong>channel theme</strong>. The theme is important for 
                me to know so I can create the atmosphere you need. I need to know what <strong>graphics</strong> you neeed from me so that
                I know what to make. The last two items we need to talk about are mostly logistics. I need to know <strong>when</strong> 
                you are looking to implement the graphics and we can talk about how long I'll need to create them. Having 
                a <strong>budget</strong> in mind is also important. My goal is to bring affordable, unique graphics and art to people 
                who otherwise wouldn't be able to have custom and unique channel artwork. I want to be able to deliver 
                you the best quality for what you can afford and what we can hash out together.
